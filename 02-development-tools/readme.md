## Genkit Developer Tools

Genkit provides a robust set of developer tools designed to simplify the process of building, testing, and debugging AI applications and workflows. These tools primarily consist of a Node.js command-line interface (CLI) and an optional local web application called the Developer UI.

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

The Genkit Node.js CLI facilitates command-line operations and can be installed globally using `npm install -g genkit-cli`.

The CLI supports several commands to streamline working with Genkit projects:

* **`genkit start -- <command to run your code>`**: This command starts the Developer UI and establishes a connection with your running code process. This connection is essential for the UI to identify the Genkit components defined in your code.
* **`genkit flow:run <flowName>`**: This command allows you to execute a specific flow directly from the command line. For this to work, your Genkit runtime must already be active in another terminal with the `GENKIT_ENV=dev` environment variable set. This is particularly useful for testing individual flows or for ad-hoc tasks, such as ingesting documents into a vector database. For streaming flows, you can add the `-s` flag to print the output to the console.
* **`genkit eval:flow <flowName>`**: Used to evaluate a specific flow. Like `flow:run`, it requires the runtime environment to be active with `GENKIT_ENV=dev`.
* **`genkit --help`**: Displays a complete list of all available CLI commands.

### Genkit Developer UI

The Genkit Developer UI is an optional local web application that provides an interactive environment for working with models, flows, prompts, and other elements within your Genkit project.

#### Starting and Connecting the Developer UI

The Developer UI connects to your running code process to identify the Genkit components you have defined. To start it, use the command `genkit start -- <command to run your code>`. The `<command to run your code>` varies depending on your project's setup, for example:

* `genkit start -- npm run dev` (for a typical development server)
* `genkit start -- npx tsx --watch src/index.ts` (for directly running a TypeScript file)
* `genkit start -- node --watch src/index.js` (for directly running a JavaScript file)

Including the `--watch` option allows the Developer UI to detect and reflect saved changes in your code without needing a restart.

Upon startup, the output will indicate the `localhost` addresses for the Telemetry API and the Developer UI, such as `Genkit Developer UI: http://localhost:4000`. You can open this address in your default browser (using the `-o` option with `genkit start` to open it automatically) or in the VS Code simple browser to view it alongside your code.

#### Developer UI Functionalities

The Developer UI features "action runners" for components defined in your code, including `flow`, `prompt`, `model`, `tool`, `retriever`, `indexer`, `embedder`, and `evaluator`.

* **Debugging Flows**: A key advantage of encapsulating AI logic in a flow is the ability to test and debug it independently of your application using the Developer UI. From the **Run** tab of the UI, you can execute any defined flow in your project. After running a flow, you can inspect a trace of its invocation on the **Inspect** tab or by clicking **View trace**. The trace viewer provides detailed information about the execution of the entire flow and each individual step within it. Fundamental Genkit actions like `generate()`, `chat.send()`, `embed()`, `index()`, and `retrieve()` appear as separate steps in the viewer. You can also include non-Genkit code in your traces by wrapping it in a `run()` call.
* **Experimentation with Models and Prompts**: The Developer UI allows you to experiment with the effect of model parameters (such as `temperature`, `top-p`, and `top-k`) on the output generated by different model and prompt combinations. It automatically loads all models defined by the configured plugins in your project, enabling quick testing of various prompts and configuration values without constant code modification.
* **Prompt Management**: You can create prompt files (`.prompt`) using the **Models** section in the Developer UI. After experimenting and being satisfied with a prompt's results and configuration, you can use the **Export** button to save the modified file back to your prompts directory.

### Analytics

The Genkit CLI and Developer UI utilize cookies and similar Google technologies to enhance service quality and analyze usage. If you wish to opt out of analytics data collection, you can run the command `genkit config set analyticsOptOut true`. To check the current setting, use `genkit config get analyticsOptOut`.
